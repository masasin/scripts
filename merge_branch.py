Description: Automate merging of git branches

Note that the default upstream branch is develop.

This code uses docopt and sh, both of which can be downloaded from PyPi. It is
compatible with Python versions 2 and 3.

Inspired by: http://www.jperla.com/blog/post/a-clean-python-shell-script

Usage:
    {name} -u | -b [--upstream=<branch>]
    {name} -h | --help
    {name} --version

Options:
    -h --help                Show this screen.
    --version                Show version.
    -u --merge-upstream      Merge the latest upstream into the current branch.
    -b --merge-branch        Merge the current branch into upstream; force -u.
    -U --upstream=<branch>   The branch to be merged. [default: develop]
